# TerminalTime

TerminalTime is a simple Python program that displays the current time in your terminal, updating every second. The screen is cleared before each update, creating a clean digital clock effect.

## Features
- Shows current time in HH:MM:SS format
- Updates every second
- Clears the terminal for a clock-like display

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies

## Usage
Run the script:
```powershell
python Code.py
```
The terminal will display the current time and update every second. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

## Notes
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals.
- Uses `cls` for Windows and `clear` for other systems to clear the screen.
