# PyShowcase
A collection of unique Python programs to showcase Pythonâ€™s versatility.

## Projects

### 1. PageCaptureCrawler
Multithreaded web crawler that uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to crawl web pages, take screenshots, and cache page content efficiently. Screenshots are saved locally, and only links within the same domain are crawled.

### 2. KnowledgeMapper
Generates a mind map from the section structure of a Wikipedia page for a given topic. Outputs both a text-based mind map in the console and a graphical mind map image using Graphviz.

### 3. ToneType
Converts text into a sequence of beeps using the Windows `winsound` library. Each character in the input text is mapped to a unique beep frequency, allowing you to "hear" the text as tones.

### 4. LiveAudioPlot
Visualizes live microphone input as a real-time ASCII bar graph in the terminal. The height of the bar represents the audio volume detected from the microphone.

Each project has its own folder and README with details, requirements, and usage instructions.
