# TypingTestCLI

TypingTestCLI is a simple command-line Python program that measures your typing speed in words per minute (WPM). It presents a random sequence of words for you to type and calculates your speed based on how quickly you enter the text.

## Features
- Randomly generates a sample text from a list of words
- Measures typing speed in WPM
- Simple and fast CLI interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies

## Usage
Run the script:
```powershell
python Code.py
```
Follow the prompt:
- Type the displayed sample text as quickly and accurately as possible.
- Press Enter when done.
- Your WPM (words per minute) will be displayed.

## Notes
- The sample text consists of 8 randomly chosen words.
- WPM is calculated based on the number of words and the time taken.
- Accuracy is not checked; only speed is measured.
